# Text-Based Adventure Game in Python

## Overview
This project is a text-based adventure game created as part of an Intro to Programming course. It features multiple character archetypes, branching storylines, and several possible endings. The game is written in Python and split into modular components for clarity and scalability.

## Features
- Character customization (name, type, attributes)
- Dynamic story based on player decisions
- Multiple character classes (e.g., Warrior, Mage, Rogue)
- Several unique endings
- Modular code structure separating logic and story

## File Structure
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `scenariodup.py` | Main game loop and storyline logic |
| `commands.py` | Utility functions and command parsing used by the game engine |

## How to Run
Ensure Python 3.x is installed. Then run the following in your terminal or IDE:
```bash
python scenariodup.py
Future Enhancements
Implement save/load functionality

Convert to object-oriented design with class-based characters

Add side quests or additional story branches

Include ASCII art or visual elements in the terminal

Key Learning Outcomes
Applied Python fundamentals including functions, loops, and conditionals

Practiced modular programming across multiple files

Developed game logic and branching narratives

Gained experience with input handling and string manipulation
